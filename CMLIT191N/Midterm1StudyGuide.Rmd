# Day One: The Etruscan Vase

The main goal of this course is the understand how the world works through video
games. In order to achieve this goal, we will have to look at video games as
cultural artifacts. Artifacts exist through all of human history, because work
does not necessarily come before "play". We may think of having to go to a 9-5
job before performing leisure, but humans have always produced stories and art.
This is why to understand culture we must be able to analyze the artifacts it 
produces.
